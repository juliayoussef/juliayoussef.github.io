# Welcome!

Hi! My name is Julia, a recent graduate from the University of Chicago in undergrad and grad school. I was a geoscience major interested in paleontology, planetary science, and earth history generally as a biogeochemical dynmamic system and tragic narrative. Outside of my major studies, I was (am) interested in the philosophy of science, visualizing the past, and religious syncretism in antiquity. Oh, and plants, rockclimbing, and art. 

This site exists for two main reasons: to document my academic projects, but also to host my writing and science-related artwork. Here, I plan to write about topics like art, recent research, current events, and my own experiences as a first-gen woman in academia. That may mean musings on the was we represent evolution itself; a review of Prehistoric Planet 3; responses to pop-science essays...generally, grapping with the role paleontology has in our daily lifes, society, and my own academic trajectory. Or, if you're interested in bigger questions – how we define evolutionary "success," where we fit on the tree of life, and how we feel about those relationships – that's here, too. And since I wasn't born into a family of academics, I'll write about how I feel about higher education, how I balance art, science, and identity, and how I try to move forward.

Oh - and occasionally I'll air my grievances about obscure papers or fawn over the newest discoveries on niche clades (with a special fondness for _Nyctosauridae_ and _Anurognathidae_, both pterosaurs, and some mammalian lineages).
