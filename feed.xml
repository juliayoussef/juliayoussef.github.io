My name is Julia, a recent graduate from the University of Chicago in undergrad and grad school. I was a geoscience major interested in paleontology, planetary science, and earth history generally as a biogeochemical dynmamic system and tragic narrative. Outside of my major studies, I was (am) interested in the philosophy of science, visualizing the past, and religious syncretism in antiquity. Oh, and plants, rockclimbing, and art.</p> <p>This site exists for two main reasons: to document my academic projects, but also to host my writing and science-related artwork. Here, I plan to write about topics like art, recent research, current events, and my own experiences as a first-gen woman in academia. That may mean musings on the was we represent evolution itself; a review of Prehistoric Planet 3; responses to pop-science essays…generally, grapping with the role paleontology has in our daily lifes, society, and my own academic trajectory. Or, if you’re interested in bigger questions – how we define evolutionary “success,” where we fit on the tree of life, and how we feel about those relationships – that’s here, too. And since I wasn’t born into a family of academics, I’ll write about how I feel about higher education, how I balance art, science, and identity, and how I try to move forward.</p> <p>Oh - and occasionally I’ll air my grievances about obscure papers or fawn over the newest discoveries on niche clades (with a special fondness for <em>Nyctosauridae</em> and <em>Anurognathidae</em>, both pterosaurs, and some mammalian lineages).</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/film-field-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/film-field-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/film-field-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/film-field.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/pano-wyoming-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/pano-wyoming-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/pano-wyoming-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/pano-wyoming.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Me in Wyoming with Professor Sereno's Dinosaur Science course! </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="paleontology"/><category term="introductory"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blog introduction and greeting and who the hell am I]]></summary></entry></feed>
