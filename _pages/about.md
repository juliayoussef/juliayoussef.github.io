I’m a recent graduate interested in reconstructing paleoecologies through time. My work combines quantitative modeling, phylogenetic analysis, and illustration to study how organisms and ecosystems change – and how we represent them through data, fossils, and art.

I studied geosciences at the University of Chicago with a minor in Astrophysics, where I learned to approach evolution as both a computational and creative problem. Now based in Hyde Park, I continue paleontological research while developing my practice in scientific illustration and paleoart.

Right now, I’m modeling the evolutionary history of pterosaurs and building frameworks that link mammalian dentition to diet through fossil specimens and literature. Both projects grapple with the gap between living organisms, the traces they leave behind, and the ways we translate that evidence into models. Alongside research, I use digital and traditional media – especially soft pastel – to reanimate extinct life and experiment with how deep time can be communicated visually as well as scientifically.
